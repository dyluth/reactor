Version: 1.0  
Status: Draft | In Review | Approved  
Author(s): \[AI Agent Name, Your Name\]  
Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## **1\. The 'Why': Rationale & User Focus**

*This section defines the purpose of the feature, the target user, and the value it delivers. It ensures we are solving the right problem for the right person.*

### **1.1. High-level summary**

\<\!--  
AI: Provide a concise, one-paragraph "elevator pitch" for this feature. Explain its core purpose and the primary benefit it provides to the end-user.  
\--\>

### **1.2. User personas**

\<\!--  
AI: Identify and describe the primary and secondary user personas for this feature. Who are they? What are their goals and motivations in the context of our application?  
**Example:**

* **Primary Persona: Data Analyst (Dana)**: Dana needs to export raw data frequently to use in external reporting tools. She values speed, accuracy, and format compatibility.  
* Secondary Persona: Project Manager (PM Pete): Pete occasionally needs high-level summary reports to share with stakeholders. He values simplicity and clear visual presentation.  
  \--\>

### **1.3. Problem statement & user stories**

\<\!--  
AI: Based on the personas, clearly articulate the problem this feature solves. Then, write specific user stories in the format: "As a \[persona\], I want to \[action\], so that \[benefit\]."  
Problem Statement:  
(e.g., "Data Analysts currently cannot export their filtered datasets, forcing them to manually copy-paste information, which is time-consuming and error-prone.")  
**User Stories:**

* As a Data Analyst, I want to export my current view as a CSV file, so that I can perform advanced analysis in Excel.  
* As a Project Manager, I want to download a PDF summary of the project dashboard, so that I can easily share project status with executives.  
  \--\>

### **1.4. Success metrics**

\<\!--  
AI: Define specific, measurable criteria for success. How will we know this feature is successful after launch? List both business and technical metrics.  
**Business Metrics:**

* (e.g., Reduce support tickets related to data export by 30% within one quarter.)  
* (e.g., Achieve a 50% adoption rate among Data Analyst users within two months.)

**Technical Metrics:**

* (e.g., P95 API response time for the export endpoint must be under 500ms.)  
* (e.g., Zero feature-related errors reported in our monitoring tools.)  
  \--\>

## **2\. The 'How': Technical Design & Architecture**

*This section details the proposed technical solution, exploring the system context, alternatives, and the specific changes required across the stack.*

### **2.1. System context & constraints**

\<\!--  
AI: Analyse the existing codebase and architecture.

* **Technology Stack:** List the key technologies, frameworks, and libraries relevant to this feature.  
* **Current State:** Describe the existing user flow or functionality that will be changed or built upon. Mention specific files, modules, or services that will be impacted.  
* Technical Constraints: List any limitations that must be considered (e.g., specific library versions, budget, performance budgets, backward compatibility).  
  \--\>

### **2.2. Guiding design principles**

\<\!--  
AI Pitfall Alert: A common failure mode is over-engineering. Your primary goal is to solve the user's problem in the simplest, most maintainable way. Before proposing a solution, confirm it adheres to these principles.

* **Simplicity over Complexity (YAGNI):** Is this the simplest possible solution that meets the user stories? Avoid adding abstractions, interfaces, or configurations that aren't required by the immediate problem. You Ain't Gonna Need It.  
* **Consistency with Existing Code:** Does this solution follow the established patterns, conventions, and architectural style of the existing codebase? Do not introduce new patterns (e.g., a new data access layer) without a compelling justification.  
* Clarity and Readability: Is the proposed code easy to understand for another developer? Favour clear, explicit code over clever, implicit magic.  
  \--\>

### **2.3. Alternatives considered**

\<\!--  
AI: Explore at least two viable technical approaches. This demonstrates thoroughness. For each option, briefly describe it and list its pros and cons.  
**Option 1: \[Brief Name, e.g., "Server-Side Generation"\]**

* **Description:** (A brief explanation of the approach.)  
* **Pros:** (e.g., "Handles large datasets well," "Reuses existing backend services.")  
* **Cons:** (e.g., "Slower initial response for the user," "Higher server load.")

**Option 2: \[Brief Name, e.g., "The Simplest Possible Approach"\]**

* **Description:** (What is the most direct, least abstract way to solve this problem?)  
* **Pros:** (e.g., "Fast to implement," "Easy to understand and maintain.")  
* **Cons:** (e.g., "May not scale to future, un-requested features.")

Chosen Approach Justification:  
(State which option was chosen and provide a clear, concise reason for the decision, linking it back to the user stories and the guiding principles above.)  
\--\>

### **2.4. Detailed design**

\<\!--  
AI: Based on the chosen approach, provide a detailed breakdown of the required changes. Where helpful, use Mermaid diagrams (e.g., flowcharts, sequence diagrams) within a code block to visualise complex logic or user flows.  
\--\>

#### **2.4.1. Data model updates**

\<\!--  
AI: Specify any new database tables, columns, or relationships. Provide schema definitions (e.g., SQL DDL, ORM model code). If no changes are needed, state "N/A".  
\--\>

#### **2.4.2. Data migration plan**

\<\!--  
AI: If the data model is changing, provide a step-by-step plan for migrating existing data. Include any scripts or commands. If no migration is needed, state "N/A".  
\--\>

#### **2.4.3. API & backend changes**

\<\!--  
AI: Define new or updated API endpoints. Specify the HTTP method, URL path, request/response formats (including status codes), and core business logic for any new services or functions.  
\--\>

#### **2.4.4. Frontend changes**

\<\!--  
AI: Describe changes to the UI. List new components (with their props and state) and modifications to existing pages.  
\--\>

### **2.5. Non-functional requirements (NFRs)**

\<\!--  
AI Pitfall Alert: Do not ignore these requirements. A feature is only successful if it is performant, reliable, and usable by everyone. Be specific and quantitative.

* **Performance:** Define specific performance targets. (e.g., "P95 API response time \< 200ms under 1000 RPM," "Initial page load must be \< 2s on a 3G connection.")  
* **Scalability:** How will this feature handle growth? (e.g., "The design must support a 10x increase in users over the next year without significant re-architecture.")  
* **Reliability:** What is the availability target? (e.g., "The export service must have 99.9% uptime.")  
* **Accessibility (a11y):** What standards must be met? (e.g., "All UI components must comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards, be fully navigable via keyboard, and tested with screen readers.")  
* Operations & Developer Experience: How will this be managed? (e.g., "All common tasks must be automated via Makefile commands. The developer onboarding time from git clone to a running local instance must be under 10 minutes.")  
  \--\>

## **3\. The 'What': Implementation & Execution**

*This section breaks the work into manageable pieces and defines the strategy for testing, documentation, and quality assurance.*

### **3.1. Phased implementation plan**

\<\!--  
AI: Break down the implementation into a sequence of logical, small pull requests (PRs). Each step should deliver a distinct, testable piece of value to the user.  
\--\>  
**Phase 1: Backend & API Setup**

* \[ \] PR 1.1: Add database schema changes and migration script.  
* \[ \] PR 1.2: Create the core export service logic (without the API endpoint).  
* \[ \] PR 1.3: Expose the new /api/export endpoint and add initial integration tests.

**Phase 2: Frontend UI**

* \[ \] PR 2.1: Create the new ExportButton React component, ensuring it meets a11y standards.  
* \[ \] PR 2.2: Add the ExportButton to the main dashboard and connect it to the API.

**Phase 3: Documentation & Operations**

* \[ \] PR 3.1: Create/update docs/ with setup, deployment, and troubleshooting guides.  
* \[ \] PR 3.2: Implement a comprehensive Makefile with all development, testing, and deployment commands.  
* \[ \] PR 3.3: Validate the \<10 minute developer onboarding experience and document common issues.

### **3.2. Testing strategy**

\<\!--  
AI: Describe the testing plan. Be specific about the scenarios and edge cases to cover for all requirement types. Crucially, ensure that every user story from section 1.3 has at least one corresponding end-to-end test to validate its implementation.

* **Unit Tests:** (e.g., "Test the formatCsv utility with empty, single-line, and multi-line inputs, including special characters.")  
* **Integration Tests:** (e.g., "Verify the API endpoint correctly authenticates users and returns a 403 Forbidden for invalid roles.")  
* **End-to-End (E2E) User Story Tests:**  
  * **User Story 1 ("As a Data Analyst..."):** (e.g., "A Cypress test that logs in as Dana, applies three filters to the data table, clicks the export button, and verifies a CSV file is downloaded.")  
  * **User Story 2 ("As a Project Manager..."):** (e.g., "A Playwright test that logs in as Pete, navigates to the project dashboard, clicks the 'Download PDF' button, and verifies a PDF is downloaded.")  
* **Performance Tests:** (e.g., "A k6 load test script to ensure the API endpoint meets the 200ms P95 NFR.")  
* Accessibility Tests: (e.g., "Run Axe accessibility audits in CI and perform manual testing with VoiceOver/NVDA screen readers.")  
  \--\>

## **4\. The 'What Ifs': Risks & Mitigation**

*This section addresses potential issues, ensuring the feature is secure, reliable, and can be deployed and managed safely.*

### **4.1. Security & privacy considerations**

\<\!--  
AI: Analyse the feature for potential security and privacy risks.

* **Authentication & Authorization:** Which user roles can access this feature? How is this enforced at the API and UI levels?  
* **Data Validation:** How will all user-provided input be validated and sanitised to prevent vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection)?  
* Data Privacy: Does this feature handle any Personally Identifiable Information (PII)? If so, what measures are in place to protect it (e.g., data masking, access logging)?  
  \--\>

### **4.2. Rollout & deployment**

\<\!--  
AI: Outline the plan for releasing this feature to users.

* **Feature Flags:** Will this feature be deployed behind a feature flag? If so, what is the flag's name and default state?  
* **Monitoring & Observability:** Be specific. What new alerts, logs, and dashboard widgets are needed to monitor the health and usage of this feature in production?  
  * **Key Metrics:** (e.g., export.success.count, export.failure.rate, export.processing.duration.p95).  
  * **Logging:** (e.g., "INFO log on request start with correlation\_id. ERROR log on failure including correlation\_id and error details.")  
  * **Alerting:** (e.g., "Trigger a PagerDuty alert if the export.failure.rate exceeds 5% over a 10-minute window.")  
* Rollback Plan: What is the procedure to safely disable or roll back this feature if a critical issue is discovered in production? (e.g., "Set the feature flag to false," "Revert PR \#123.")  
  \--\>

### **4.3. Dependencies and integrations**

\<\!--  
AI: Identify all internal and external dependencies required for this feature to function.

* **Internal Dependencies:** (e.g., "This feature requires the AuthenticationService to be available.")  
* **External Dependencies:** (e.g., "This feature uses the Stripe API for payment processing. We must handle its rate limits and potential downtime.")  
* Data Dependencies: (e.g., "This feature relies on the daily\_user\_summary data pipeline, which runs every 24 hours.")  
  \--\>

### **4.4. Cost and resource analysis**

\<\!--  
AI: Provide a high-level estimate of the infrastructure and operational costs associated with this feature.

* **Infrastructure Costs:** (e.g., "This feature will require a new t3.medium RDS instance, estimated at £30/month.")  
* Operational Costs: (e.g., "This is expected to increase the on-call support burden by \~1 hour per week due to potential user data issues.")  
  \--\>

### **4.5. Open questions & assumptions**

\<\!--  
AI: List any open questions that need answers and document any assumptions made during planning.  
**Open Questions:**

* (e.g., "What is the maximum number of rows we need to support for CSV export?")

**Assumptions:**

* (e.g., "We assume that all users have browser permissions enabled to download files.")
